Common Collection Patterns
==========================

Got the inspiration from [funcy](https://github.com/Suor/funcy) and
being tired of typing the same things over and over.

How to install
--------------

-   `pip install common_col_patterns`

Usage
-----

-   Currently you will have to browse the sources

Missing functionality
---------------------

-   Submit a PR or ping me if you have anything you would like to have -
    or found a bug

Disclosure
----------

Runtimes of all the functions have not been benchmarked - nor it has
been optimized, if using any of attached function in a computation heavy
manner - verify the performance first
